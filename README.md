# ATM Finder AR App For Android Mobile Devices

Java application for showing nearest ATM and bank locations with address and distance information for a banking company using Augmented Reality for Android. 

Used Google's [ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar "ARCore") software development kit for creating Augmented Reality interface because of Motion Tracking technology of ARCore

Utilized [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit "Retrofit") to get the information that I will use in the AR interface

To run this project on your local device, use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio "Android Studio")
